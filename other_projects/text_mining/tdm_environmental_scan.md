**Preliminary Notes:**
- Text/data mining support is often dispersed among a number of different units within academic institutions - in addition to scholarly communication units, support is often found in GIS services, data services, or digital scholarship units, as well as non-library computing, digital humanities, or statistical support centers
- Library-provided services in relation to text/data mining often focus on licensing terms and communicating if and how library subscription resources can be used for text/data mining
    - a number institutions provide detailed guidance on legal issues related to text/data mining, including the potential for licening restrictions to override fair use
- Libraries often place explicit limitations on the scope of support they can offer for text/data mining
    - UPenn, for instance, explicitly states that while they can offer one-on-one consultations, workshops, and university-wide licensing negotiation for text/data mining permissions, they cannot seek individual licenses for text/data mining projects or storage of data for mining (https://guides.library.upenn.edu/penntdm)
