### Week 2 - 1/15/2018

This week, I helped to prepare materials for a classroom instruction session scheduled for next week. I reviewed and expanded on slides and notes prepared by supervisor, adding a section to the presentation providing practical guidance for students on copyright infringement.

I also continued the work related to library gifts and donations that began last week, and was able to hear how discussion on this issue had proceeded at a recent library-wide meeting. I was able to provide some additional research that addressed some of the issues raised at this meeting, and it was enlightening to understand the concerns about this process raised by stakeholders who shepherd various stages of the donation process.

My supervisor and I began some initial preparation for our planned workshop on contracts for library staff, and discussed potential examples. We are particularly interested in finding examples that will be accessible to a non-legal audience but still illustrate the complexity of contracts relevant to library work. We also scheduled and arranged space for this workshop in coordination with other librarians.
