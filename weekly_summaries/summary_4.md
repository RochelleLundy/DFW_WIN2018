Week 4 - 1/29/2018

- Fandom class session - classroom layout made student engagement difficult
- French class session: preparation by creation of slides on origins of copyright and international copyright issues; longer session than expected, but very engaged class with interesting questions; view into how copyright issues fit in with broader humanities curriculum
- Workshop - fair use: Fandom class sparked interest in using harry potter case as a fair use example - idea that a book example may be of interest to librarians
- provides a different type of example on purpose factor - i.e. doesn't have to be a parody/satire/commentary; a reference work is sufficient
- inquiry re Casals masterclass recordings - use of s.108 ('obsolete format'); previous publication issues; complications of work + recording; importance of judgment in assessing risk and providing guidance
