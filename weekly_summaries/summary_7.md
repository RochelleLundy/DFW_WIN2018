Week 7 - 2/19/2018

This week, we made the final selection of cases for our fair use workshop. Our goal was to select cases that represent decisions both for and against fair use, and that have relevance to work in academic libraries. We settled on three cases, including one that directly involves the use of letters housed in an academic library archive and another that addresses organizing copyighted videos and associated metadata into searchable databases, an emerging issue for libraries considering the acquisition of this type of electronic resource. The third case is not directly related to library work, but involves a visual copyrighted work that can be displayed to workshop participants and thus will serve as an introductory case around which to begin discussion and to orient participants to fair use concerns. I prepared a handout summarizing the relevant facts of these cases that participants will refer to during the workshop when assessing how fair use law may apply, and worked with my supervisor to develop a set of presentation slides and summary of legal issues.

I also continued researching services provided by academic libraries with respect to text and data mining. In particular, I began collecting sample LibGuides and sample event listings relating to these services.
